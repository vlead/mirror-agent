* DOCUMENT PURPOSE 
- The Solution Architecture Definition defines the overall
architectural solution for the "Mirroring of Virtual-labs at
IITD". The solution addresses the problem as documented in the *VLEAD
Mandate - Virtual Labs Integration: Deliverables, Resources and Budget
2012-06-02" (Jun 2012)*.  The solution comprises a number of elements
or components, which are partitioned into subsets for
implementation. The primary audience of this document consists of IT
and network architects.The primary purpose of this document is to
communicate the essential elements of the overall solution so that
operatational implications can be assessed and understood, and so that
the design activities in Design & Build can proceed further.  As such
it achieves the following:
- It provides visibility and exposure to other architects for peer
  review.
- It unambiguously defines the overall solution to the proposed
  requirements of the initiative.
- It provides a basis for assessment of the overall solution once
  implemented.
- It describes how the development and deployment of the solution can
  be phased if this is required to meet needs and or to meet
  technology constraints
* PROJECT OVERVIEW AND STATUS 
- VLEAD (Virtual Labs Engineering and Architecture Division) team was
setup in June 2012 as a central engineering team for integrating all
the virtual-labs (around 180 in number) across all disciplines and
institutes onto a common data-center (currently located at IIIT
Hyderabad). Currently(as of 2013-08-15) around 86 lab sources are
version-controlled and around 40 hosted out of IIIT
data-centre. Hence, it becomes absolutely necessary to have atleast
the sources mirrored at an additional location (identified as IIT
Delhi) so as to ensure availability, reliability and faster recovery
of *Virtual Labs* in case of unforeseen disasters or catastropes.
- In very long term, the plan is to achieve live mirroring of all the
  lab content as well as to run *Virtual labs* out
  of multiple sites to ensure better availability, reliability and
  performance.

* PROJECT SCOPE 
 - The scope of this project is to have the sources of all
the Virtual-labs mirrored at one of the servers at IIT
Delhi. Additionally, other critical data on VLEAD VMs and Containers
are also planned to be mirrored as part of this initiative.

* SOLUTION OVERVIEW
** Current Architecture Overview
   [[./Current-Backup-Model.png]] 
  - Sources of all Virtual-labs are stored in the version-control
VM(svn.virtual-labs.ac.in/bzr.virtual-labs.ac.in/git.virtual-labs.ac.in)
at Virtual Labs DataCenter, IIIT Hyderabad. These sources are uploaded
(checked-in) and downloaded (checked-out) over HTTP and SSH publicly
by different lab developers across all the institutes. This critical
data is already backed-up on a storage server(SAN) located in the same
data-center.
  - Additionally, there is also critical data belonging to services
provided by VLEAD (eg. ldap, developer-portal, ns, mail) which is used
by Virtual-labs community and VLEAD internally. This data is across
different Virtual machines setup at Virtual Labs DataCenter, IIIT
Hyderabad. Selected file-systems from all these VMs is already
backed-up on the same storage server(SAN) in the existing data-center.
** Proposed Architecture Overview 
   [[./Mirroring-Proposed.png]]
 - All the critical data(as described above) at IIIT DataCenter
   will be mirrored at an offsite location(IIT, Delhi) using a
   mechanism that syncs data overnight at a specified time everyday.
 - In Phase-I, a overnight cronjob would be scheduled at the IIIT
   data-center to push all the virtual-lab sources from
   version-control server to the mirrored location at IITD.
 - In Phase-II, the cronjob would be modified to additionally backup
   VLEAD service VMs from the storage server(SAN) to mirrored location at IITD.
** Architectural Decisions 
     - Here are a summary of significant decisions and the rationale behind
the decisions used to derive the solution. This table represents a
single decision and each decision in a table format.

|                        |                                                                                                                            |
| Issue or Problem       | Which backup/restore tool should be used ?                                                                                 |
| Assumptions            |                                                                                                                            |
| Motivation             | - Data sizes are huge, hence need to have a mechanism to send incremental data rather than sending all the data everytime. |
|                        | - Backup/Restore process should be recoverable, so that in case of failure, it can start from the place it failed.         |
|                        | - Backup/Restore process should work seamlessly with a subset of data without any additional efforts.                      |
|                        | - Transfer of data over public network should be secure and encrypted.                                                     |
|                        | - Should be scalable (atleast up to the estimated specifications).                                                         |
|                        | - Should complete within stipulated time-frames and not interfere with system's normal operations.                         |
|                        | - Should be automated requiring as less manual intervention as possible.                                                   |
|                        | - Backup tool should preserve the user/group/timestamp attributes.                                                         |
|                        | - Data needs to be pushed rather than pulled to enable VLEAD team to monitor the backup/restore process.                   |
|                        | - Should send data with parallel/simultaneous connections and in compressed format.                                        |
|                        |                                                                                                                            |
| Options                | Rsync, SCP (Secure Copy), Rsnapshot(uses rsync), Clonezilla (works at image level)                                         |
|                        |                                                                                                                            |
| Decision               | 'rsync' tool to be used and scheduled on crontab. Data will be pushed from the source to the destination.                  |
|                        |                                                                                                                            |
| Justification          | Rsync seems to closely satisfy all the requirements as mentioned in the motivation:                                        |
|                        | - SCP cant be used in an incremental fashion and doesnot preserve filesystem attributes.                                   |
|                        | - Rsnapshot is a good tool but applicable when it runs on destination and pulls data from source.                          |
|                        | - Clonezilla or other Imaging tools work at disk/filesystem level and not applicable in complete or partial                |
|                        | backup/restore of directories.                                                                                             |
|                        |                                                                                                                            |
| Implications           | 'rsync' tool should be available on both the systems and an SSH account on the mirror-system is required                   |

** Architectural Risks 
    Key architectural risks are as follows:
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------|
| Risk [AR] | Description                                     |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------|
| AR - 01   | Mirroring speed has an upper-limit equal to the |
|           | network latencies of ISPs and                   |
|           | hence the solution cannot be scaled infinitely. |
| AR - 02   | Security is compromised as data travels using   |
|           | different ISPs over public network              |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------|
                        
* SOLUTION DESCRIPTION 
** Functional Model 
   - The backup would be scheduled at 8:00PM overnight everyday.
   - In case of a failure, the backup process would be configured to
     retry a maximum of three times after a gap of 15 minutes between
     each trial.
** Re-use of Components 
 - Pre-existing rsnapshot backup/restore scripts and configurations
   developed for backups to the local storage(SAN) server at IIITH
   will be used as a baseline and will be re-used to implement the
   solution.
** Information and Data Characterstics 
*** Data Types
    - All lab sources data to be mirrored are in repositories in the form of unix directories and flat-files.
    - Databases would be dumped into flat(.sql) files and then backed-up as flat-files.

    - The mirrored data is not compressed or encrypted and will have
      the same file-system structure as on the source
      file-system. This is required as in our use-case, partial
      restore of the data will be required mostly where a specific
      lab or VM data is required to be restored. Hence, it is
      *required* that the mirrored system be kept in a secured area
      where data cannot be compromised.
** Infrastructure Model
*** Source(IIIT Hyderabad Datacenter)
     - No additional infrastructure is required at IIITH Datacenter for this solution
*** Target(IIT Delhi DataCenter)   
     - Following are required specifications of the target system
       where the mirrored data is required to be kept:
	+ Standard Rack mounted Server(Multi-core Intel Xeon Series Processor)                                           
	+ Linux based OS (CentOS preferred)
	+ Minimum 16GB of RAM                                      
	+ Atleast 1TB of available space after (RAID)  
	+ Redundant power backup                                  
	+ RAID Configured for reliability and optimum performance.
	+ Multiple network interfaces (if possible).
     - Proposed system: *IBM System x3650 M4*      
         http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/in/x/hardware/rack/x3650m4/index.html
** Integration and Network Design 
   - A dedicated 2Mbps link is proposed for the mirroring system at IITD
** Security Architecture 
  - This section describes the security controls that will be
    incorporated into the solution.
*** Network Security 
 - No special security features will be implemented as part of this
   solution apart from any features that already exist or are provided
   by the tools used as part of the solution.
     + E.g Using rsync server, the target mirror will be configured to
       accept connections only form source and will reject connections
       from any other hosts.
     + Only required ports will be made open on the source and target
       systems.
*** System Security 
 - No additional system security solutions would be implemented. The
   source and target systems will be secured by default options
   provided by Linux Operating system (PAM, SSH Key-based/password
   authentication, IPtable Firewalls)
*** Application Security 
 - This will not be applicable as the mirrored-location will be
dedicated for this solution and no additional applications will be
allowed to be running out of the system.
 - No special application level authentication/authorization will be
   implemented. Authentication and authorization will work at system
   level and covered by system security.
*** Operational Security 
 - For operational purposes, the mirrored-system super-user
   credentials will be only shared amoung ??
** Privacy   
 - No specific measures are proposed to be implemented as part of the
   solution to cater to safeguard private data. This is a risk which
   is mitigated by having security at system level and physical level.
** Performance 
 - The performance of the system would greaterlly depend on the
     network speed of the ISP at both source(IIIT Hyderabad) and
     mirrored location(IITD) and hence

*** Performance Modelling

|-----------------------+------------+-------------+---------+---------+----------+------------------|
** Reliability and Availability 
 - The solution is required to be available all the time (24*7*365).
 - Any outages at source or target mirror locations should be planned
   and notified apriori to that appropriate measures can be taken.
 - Following would be implemented at platform and network level:
    + Hardware Level RAID Configuration would be used to ensure redundancy.
    + Multiple network ports on source and mirrored-system can be implemented.
    + Redundant power supply can ensure more availability.
 - No measures at the application level will be implemented to
   ensure further reliability and availability.
*** Availability Modelling 
** Scalability 
   - The proposed solution is already planned to be scalable to the
     upper limits mentioned in the data characterstic specifications
     right from its inception and hence no specific
     scalability features would be implemented.
* OPERATIONS 
** Monitoring
 - The backup solution will be monitored manually once
   daily by the VLEAD Engineering team.
** Alarms and Notifications 
 - No automated alarms will configured. Will be tackled on a reactive
   basis as per the escalation matrix.
 - Email notifications will be configured 
** Reporting 
 - No Reporting mechanisms are implemented as part of this solution.
** Capacity Planning 
 - Capacity planning for the entire solution is done in first stage
   itself and hence not required during operational phase of this
   project.
* SOLUTION ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA  
 - The solution should be fast enough to run over-night and not affect
   normal operations of the systems and network.
* IMPLEMENTATION AND MIGRATION
 - The solution is proposed to be implemented in two phases:
  | Phase    | Description                   | Dependencies |
